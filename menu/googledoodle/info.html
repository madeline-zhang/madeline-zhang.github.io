			<h3>Happy Spring Festival, or more commonly known as, Chinese New Year! Today marks the first day of the lunar calendar this year. According to the zodiac cycle, 2022 is the year of the Tiger, which represents power and fear. People born in the year of the Tiger are considered optimistic, courageous, and self-confident. <br><br>

			The Spring Festival brings many traditional activities along with it, some including: dragon and lion dances, exchanging of "lucky money," dumpling making, lanterns, fireworks, and paper cutting. This google doodle highlights the art of paper cutting. Paper cutting is popular for it's highly decorative and low cost creation and is used for rituals, celebrations, and gifts. They are usually cut in red paper, which is a symbolically prosperous color in Chinese culture. <br><br>

			This celebration usually lasts for about two weeks, plenty of time to eat loads of delicious food and spend time with family. Much like New Years in the Gregorian calendar, Chinese New Year is a time to start fresh with resolutions and other goals. Happy Year of the Tiger!</h3>
