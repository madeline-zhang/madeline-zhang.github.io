			<h3>This work of art is most likely not a Banksy. Banksy is known for his controversial topics and slogans in unique environments. Although this artwork is painted in a very similar art style and seems to hold a similar politically or socially driven message, there are a few reasons why this newspaper boy is someone else's work. <br><br>

				Mainly, this graffiti is located in a low-foot-traffic portion near a university, and the target audience does not seem to be students. Banksy would have maximized the location and message of a mural. Also, this piece emphasizes the use of stencils, which Banksy doesn't seem to do in his other works. He does use stencils in some of his installations, but it doesn't look like a practice he would promote in an art piece.<br><br>

			It's likely that this mural was painted by Jef Aerosol, whom Northeastern commissioned to spruce up the campus. There are several similar artworks around campus that exude the same energy. They all seem more light hearted, there more for the purpose of jazzing up a student's walk to class than to make aware a political issue. For these reasons, this newspaper boy is not a Banksy.</h3>
